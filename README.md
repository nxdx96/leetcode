## LeetCode Study Progress

This repo tracks my ongoing LeetCode study plan—what I am focusing on, what has been solved, and what is queued up next. The goal is to keep momentum visible at a glance and make it easy to iterate on weak areas.

### Snapshot (updated 2025-11-16)
| Metric | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Problems solved | 0 |
| Current streak (days) | 0 |
| Average problems / week | 0 |
| Study sessions logged | 0 |

### Focus Goals
- Build daily consistency: minimum 1 problem or 30 minutes of review per day.
- Prioritize core categories first (Arrays, DP, Graphs) before branching out.
- Capture post-problem learnings immediately so mistakes are not repeated.

### Difficulty Breakdown
| Difficulty | Target % | Solved |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Easy | 40% | 0 |
| Medium | 45% | 0 |
| Hard | 15% | 0 |

### Category Tracker
| Topic | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Arrays / Strings | Kick-off focus. Track sliding-window vs two-pointer patterns. |
| Dynamic Programming | Rebuild template library (top-down + bottom-up). |
| Graph / Tree | Review traversal templates and union-find refreshers. |
| Math / Bits | Keep quick-reference of formulas, avoid re-deriving daily. |

### Study Log
| Date | Problems / Activity | Takeaways |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-16 | Planning session | Established tracking template and goals. |

### Next Up
- Solve at least 5 array/string problems to validate refresher work.
- Draft reusable templates (sliding window, prefix sums, BFS/DFS) inside this repo.
- Reflect weekly: note which topics slow me down and adjust the plan.
